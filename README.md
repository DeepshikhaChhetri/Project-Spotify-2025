# Project Plan
## 1. Project Overview
As a BI Analyst at Spotify, my objective was to develop a data-driven Tableau dashboard that provides key stakeholders with actionable insights on revenue, cost efficiency, user growth, and profitability trends. The dashboard is designed to support strategic, financial, and operational decision-making based on stakeholder requirements.

## 2. Approach & Stakeholder Analysis
To ensure the dashboard aligns with business needs, I conducted a stakeholder requirement analysis by asking targeted questions to understand the metrics and insights they need to monitor.

### Stakeholder Questions & Insights Mapped to Dashboard Design
#### ðŸ“Š General Dashboard Questions (for all stakeholders)
- What are the 3-5 most critical KPIs you monitor regularly?
- What decisions will this dashboard support?
- How frequently will you use this dashboard (daily/weekly/monthly)?
- What data visualization style do you prefer (tables, charts, interactive drill-downs)?
  
#### ðŸŽ¯ Sarah (Head of Strategy) â€“ Focus: User Growth
- How have Total, Premium, and Ad-Supported MAUs evolved over time?
- What leading indicators can help forecast future user trends?
- Would an interactive drill-down feature for user segmentation be useful?
  
#### ðŸ’° Mark (Director of Revenue) â€“ Focus: Revenue Optimization
- What revenue streams (Premium vs. Ad-Supported) are driving growth?
- How does Premium ARPU fluctuate, and what affects it?
- What kind of revenue breakdowns (subscription type, region, advertising vs. premium) are most helpful?
  
#### ðŸ’¼ Olivia (VP of Operations) â€“ Focus: Cost & Profitability
- How do Sales & Marketing (S&M), R&D, and Operational Costs impact revenue trends?
- How can we identify cost-saving opportunities without reducing quality?
- What cost-to-revenue ratio should we monitor to optimize expenses?
  
## 3. Dashboard Plan & Mockup
Based on the insights from stakeholders, I designed the following dashboard mockup to provide a structured view of Spotifyâ€™s financial and user growth performance.
